  bio: You know that kid that pissed off his parents because he took apart the VCR and didn't have the attention span to put it back together? That was me. Luckily, my attention span has improved since then. Maybe. Probably not. Oh look a bus...<br><br> My early days of tinkering lead me down a rabbit hole of computer programming and learning about hardware. The advent of great things like Raspberry Pi's and Arduinos have only helped cement my wonderfully terrible love of making gadgets. I seem have way too many project ideas rattling around up in my engineer brain.<br><br>So welcome to my blog! I am putting up how-to's for makers, especially with raspberry pi's. I also use this site to show off some of my projects and keep my followers up to date. Be sure to follow and interact with me on instagram and twitter, as well as the comments sections on this site. Happy making.
