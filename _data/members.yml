  proBio: James is a first year graduate student in nuclear engineering at the University of Idaho. He is currently writing grants targeting improving Computational Fluid Dynamics with reduced-order modeling and machine learning techniques. He also works on modeling contaminate flows using mass transport phenomena. Additonally, James serves as a TA, developing course cirriculum for the University of Idaho's Nuclear Technology Managment program.<br><br>   Prior to UI, James worked as an energy forecasting and modeling intern at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory where he worked on large scale linear optimization models focused on electric capacity forecasting. During his undegraduate work in the chemical engineering department at Brigham Young University, James was also involved in studies focusing on nuclear reactor economics, nuclear thermal energy storage, and carbon capture.
