  bio: You know that kid that pissed off his parents because he took apart the VCR and didn't have the attention span to put it back together? That was me. Luckily, my attention span has improved since then. Probably...<br><br> This blog is a place where I dump all my electronics projects, guides, and ideas. I play a lot with the Raspberry Pi, but that doesn't mean I don't veer in to arduinos, other electronics, or even other DIY. <br><br> Connect with me on twitter for updates. Project ideas are always welcome.
