James is a 4th year PhD student in nuclear engineering at the University of Idaho and a Graduate Fellow at Idaho National Laboratory. As a full time Graduate Fellow at INL, James is responsible for several projects dealing with techno economic analysis of nuclear integrated energy systems. This work generally assesses the economics of the nuclear plant participating in the electricity market against building, operating and dispatching an alternative such as hydrogen or water through desalination. James is studying these systems in both regulated and deregulated electricity markets. Some examples include desalination of water in Arizona coupled with the Palo Verde Nuclear Plant, analysis of hydrogen production from a high temperature gas reactor in the Japan, or coupling with capacity expansion runs (from US-REGEN) to inform capacity evolution when performing this dispatch. Through this work, James has worked with collaborators from Arizona Public Service, Xcel Energy, Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Energy Policy Research Institute (EPRI), and NREL, Oakridge, Argonne national labs.

Prior to INL and the University of Idaho, James worked as an energy forecasting and modeling intern at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory where he worked with the ReEDS capacity expansion modeling team. While there, he performed analysis with ReEDS to understand effects of early nuclear plant retirement on future capacity scenarios. He also developed a method for quantifying storage and the capacity value of solar using a sequential hourly time history between ReEDS solve years. 

James was also a part of undergraduate research teams at Brigham Young University that modeled thermal energy storage for nuclear plants, performed unit commitment and dispatch for a novel carbon capture system to investigate the "storage" effects of shifting CCS load when needed, and developed a model for comparing the economics of various electricity generators.

James has experience with electricity market structure, bidding practices, nuclear and other power system economics. He has been a user and developed code for the ReEDS capacity expansion model and has familiarity with other models such as US-REGEN and NEMS. James has coding experience in Python, R, C++, JavaScript, Matlab, and several proprietary optimization languages.
