title: Controlling Raspberry Pi Temperature with a Fan

Ages ago, I 3D printed [this case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:516809) with fan attachment from Thingiverse for my RPI 2B. It's cool, but when I started using the case with a retropie machine, I noticed the fan is stupid loud and is on all the time. Like I can never escape it...

To subdue my inevitably going insane, I decided to write a script that controls the fan and only turns it on when needed, much like how an actual computer fan works. 

## Materials

- Raspberry Pi (mine is a 3).
- 5v, 3" by 3" computer fan. Different cases will require different sizes. 
- Transistor. 2N2222 NPN Transistor. Other NPN transistors may also work.
- Breadboard wires.
- Heat sinks for extra cooling.

Optional:
- Breadboard. If you don't have one get one. They are really useful.
- A case. Not necessarily required, but it makes mounting the fan easier

## Connecting the Fan

Wiring the fan is pretty simple. Use an NPN transistor to connect the ground, 5v, and GPIO pin, as shown in the diagram. You need to do this because the fan can't run off the standard 3.3v that the gpio outputs. A transistor stops the current flow between the 5v and ground until a signal from the GPIO is given. When the GPIO is active, the transistor allows for the current from 5v to ground to flow freely. (For more, [see here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/transistors))

## Controlling the Fan

The next step is to write code to control the fan. First we have to collect the CPU temperature. Luckily, python has some handy libraries for that.

```python
#This Function reads the current CPU temperature and returns a number
import os

def CPUtemp():
    res = os.popen('vcgencmd measure_temp').readline()
    temp =(res.replace("temp=","").replace("'C\n",""))
    return temp
```

Now that we have the CPU temperature, we can talk about GPIO.
