## Controlling Raspberry Pi Temperature with a Fan

[picture of the case and the breadboard]

Ages ago, I 3D printed this case with fan attachment from Thingiverse for my RPI 2B. It's cool, but when I started using the case with a retropie machine, I noticed the fan is stupid loud and is on all the time. Like I can never escape it...

To subdue my inevitably going insane, I decided to write a script that controls the fan and only turns it on when needed, much like how an actual computer fan works. 

## Materials

[Picture of materials]

- Raspberry Pi (mine is a 3).
- 5v, 3" by 3" computer fan. Different cases will require different sizes. 
- Transistor. [What numbers?]
- Breadboard wires.
- Heat sinks for extra cooling.

Optional:
- Breadboard. If you don't have one get one. They are really useful.
- A dope AF case.
