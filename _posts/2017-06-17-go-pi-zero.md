## RPI zero Action Camera

This build uses a Raspberry Pi Zero as the brain for a fully waterproof, GoPro accessory compatible action camera. I call it the Go Pi Zero. Because names make everything snazzier.

Since I have a GoPro knock off (Xiaomi Yi), I wanted to build an action camera from a Pi Zero that worked with the GoPro style accessories that I already had. It was also important to me to have a waterproof camera. After searching around, I saw some cool 3D printed cams, like this [Adafruit one](https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-wearable-time-lapse-camera/overview) and this [original pi camera](http://www.cya.nyc/2015/04/raspberry-pi-action-camera/), but I couldn’t find anything that was waterproof. I looked at waterpoof boxes for passports and all that nonsense when I thought, duh, just stick it in a GoPro case.
 
I went to my Xiaomi case, which is the same size as the GoPro, and of course the zero doesn’t fit. A night of searching GoPro knock off specs actually brought me back to Xiaomi. Their relatively new Yi 4k camera is actually wide enough to facilitate a pi with an SD card and a camera cable. It’s tight, but everything fits. 
 
The camera is a Raspberry Pi V1 camera that I had kicking around. It is mounted in the case with a couple dabs of hot glue. That has kept it secure through all the mountain biking runs I have put it through and if it doesn’t rattle off while mountain biking, it probably never will. 
 
The battery is a 3.6v 1200 mAh Lipo that I got off amazon for 10 bucks. There is a board that steps the output up to 5v that came from an external cell phone battery pack (here). I used that board because I had it, but an adafruit powerboost or similar would work well here. I connected all that up to the board and life was good.
 
So the last step was adding i/o controls. There is a button and an LED wired to the Zero’s GPIO. The LED defaults to on when the Pi is not recording. After the button is pressed, the Pi starts recording and turns off the LED. Simply press again to end recording. Long pressing safely shuts down the Pi so I don’t have to do a hard shut off every time I use it. This is all controlled with a python script that starts up at boot. Script is in this Github repo.

In the future I may make a couple of improvements. I want to try a [wide angle lense](https://www.amazon.com/SainSmart-Fish-Eye-Camera-Raspberry-Arduino/dp/B00N1YJKFS) since a larger field of view is desirable with an action camera. Also, you may have noticed the lack of a microphone. I don’t care about this too much since the Go Pi is usually my secondary camera, but it would be a fairly easy add. The one issue that I have yet to solve completely is file transfer. I now have to either pull the SD card and put it in my Pi 2 or pull the entire zero out to transfer video files. I did finally get my hands on a couple Zero Ws, so I might see if ftp is easier, but video files are huge, so I am not super confident. Aside from that I am pretty happy with the way it turned out.
